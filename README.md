# Seat_Reservation
A program which allows us to 'book' seats in a basic cinema screen.

This program reads in the data from the seatRes.txt file. This is where the previous bookings are stored and loaded when required by the program.

There are 3 options the user can perform;
  - Add a booking
  - Change a booking
  - Exit the program
